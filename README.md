A new Flutter project.

##### screenshots about this app in demo screenshot folder

in this app i learn

- too many packages [image picker package] to be able to take pictures with the camera and show this picked image in a container for review, i use an XFile instead of     using PickedFile as the documentation say (https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker 'image picker readme file'), i also learn how to convert an XFile to File and that       images are saved on the database as Files and when you want to display it you can use Image.file

- [sqflite] i have a prior knowledge about sql so it was my fav package

- [location] i learn how to check if the detect location is active or not and if not how to request it and how to ask the user for permission to detect his current         location, and how to get the latitude, longitude for the user

- [google_maps_flutter] i need this package to show the google map because unfortunately i have no pilling account to use google maps api and showing the marker

- [geocoding] it's the same idea in android about how to convert (address to lat and long which is called geocoding) & convert (lat and long to address which is called     reverse geocoding)
- adding new feature to select image by picking it by camera or gallery
